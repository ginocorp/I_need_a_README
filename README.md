## Installation

* Created a git repository
* Used the index.js and generateMarkdown.js files provided to me to create a sampleREADME.md
* Added the key questions needed in a "README.md" in the index.js and used the inquirer package to prompt question to the command-line
* Created a rubric on the generateMarkdown.js to collect the information given after each question was prompted on the command-line
* Added writeToFile function to index.js to push answers to generateMarkdown.js rubric 

## Difficulties
* The main issue I ran into was the license badge not displaying as an image on the sampleREADME.md, but was able to fix after figuring out the typo.
